<p data-end="2083" data-start="2067">For best results, apply <a href="https://regenixal.com/">Regenixal</a> Hair Oil regularly as part of your hair care routine. Start by pouring a small amount of oil into your palm, then gently massage it into your scalp using your fingertips in slow, circular motions. This helps stimulate blood circulation and ensures the oil is absorbed deep into the roots. Gradually work the oil through the length of your hair, from roots to tips, to nourish and protect the strands. For optimal absorption, leave the oil on for at least 2 to 4 hours, or overnight if possible. You can cover your hair with a shower cap or towel to avoid staining your pillow and to allow better penetration. After the oil has been absorbed, wash your hair thoroughly with a mild, sulfate-free shampoo.<strong data-end="2081" data-start="2067"> <br /></strong></p>
